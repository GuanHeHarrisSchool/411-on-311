None of these tables have indexes. We should fix that. 

allcalls2: 20613787 records. Table of complete call records from 1998. In the .csv's on EC2 (/mnt/data1/Indicies/full311) there are duplicate records across files. Ed munged these out, and allcalls2 is the result.

allcalls2_type_counts_2009: Has columns for service_description, serviece_abbreviation, and a total count of calls since 2009 for the *service_description*  (NOTE that a service_abreviation is often used to represent many distinct service_descriptions)

tract_totals_2009: 866 records. Call totals since 2009 for each census tract

fullthreeoneone_2009: 6846884 records. 6689002 records whith spatial coordinates. All records from allcalls2 that are from 2009 or later. 

fullthreeoneone_tract: 20223996 records (All the records from allcalls that had spatial coordinates). 311 calls associated with a tract from the shapefile. Namelsad has a spelled-out name of the tract. Geoid contains the tract # within a much longer identifier. This table is slow to generate/work with because it isn't clumped into counts. 

fullthreeoneone_tract_2009: 6688990 records. You guessed it! Every record from fullthreeoneone_tract from 2009 or later. 

fullthreeoneone_tract_counts4: 1452340 records. Fields: name (tract name), service_description, year, and counts. The counts are broken down by tract, service, and year. 

fullthreeoneone_tract_counts_2009: Sum of counts: 6688990. Fields are geoid, service_description, and counts. I have not idea why there are 12 fewer records (compared to fullthreeoneone_2009 w. spatial.) Gander: there were 12 records without a service_abbreviaiton. 

fullthreeoneone_tract_counts_description_2009: 205821 records. all calls since 2009 grouped by tract and service_description. 

geography_columns: empty table with lots of columns. Seems useless, but I'm wary of dropping it because it might be an automatically generated and important thing. 

geometry_columns: 16 records. Don't remember making this...maybe Ed did, or maybe it's auto. Wary of deleting. 

##Stuff from when we thought we were going to be working only with potholes

potholes: Open portal 311 records on potholes

pothole_tract: Open portal 311 records on potholes mapped to census tracts

(*) side note: the open-portal data is encoded in an Eastern-Illinois-centric projection measured in feet. The srid isn't in postgres by default, so it has to be loaded with this monster command (INSERT into spatial_ref_sys (srid, auth_name, auth_srid, proj4text, srtext) values ( 102671, 'esri', 102671, '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=36.66666666666666 +lon_0=-88.33333333333333 +k=0.9999749999999999 +x_0=300000 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +to_meter=0.3048006096012192 +no_defs ', 'PROJCS["NAD_1983_StatePlane_Illinois_East_FIPS_1201_Feet",GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",DATUM["North_American_Datum_1983",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",984249.9999999999],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-88.33333333333333],PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.999975],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",36.66666666666666],UNIT["Foot_US",0.30480060960121924],AUTHORITY["EPSG","102671"]]');) It's srid is 102671.
