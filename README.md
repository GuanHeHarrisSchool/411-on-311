This repository contains the code generated by a project in the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship.

The project aims at providing predictive analytics to the City of Chicago by working on the data generated by requests of 3-1-1 (non emergency) requests in recent years, with the goal of making the delivery of such services more efficient and more proactively.
