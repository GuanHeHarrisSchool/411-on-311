This repository contains the code generated by work for the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship.

Two related projects are in this repo:

1)  One project examines 3-1-1 (non-emergency) service requests with the ultimate aim of constructing a statistical model of the occurrence of service requests around the city.  Some exploratory work is in directories "acs-census" and "misc", with some preliminary models for potholes and graffiti in the "analysis" directory.

2)  The second project is contained in the "streetlights_crime" directory.  We examine whether street light outages cause higher levels of crime using an interrupted time series approach.  The results will help the Chicago Department of Transportation decide if they need to respond to street light service requests more quickly in order to lower crime.
