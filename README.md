This project examines 3-1-1 (non-emergency) service requests with the ultimate aim of constructing a statistical model of the occurrence of service requests around the city.  Some exploratory work is in directories "acs-census" and "misc", with some preliminary models for potholes and graffiti in the "analysis" directory.
